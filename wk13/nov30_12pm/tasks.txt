-Create a global variable named temperature
    -give it a random value between 1 and 20

-Create a thread that reads that temperature value
- and only alters if if the temperature is odd
- alters it by adding 3 to the temperatures
-repeat this action (time.sleep) every 1 second
-run this thread

Create a thread that always decreases the global temperature
value by 1
repeat this action every 2 seconds
-run this thread

-note your observations from running the two threads
